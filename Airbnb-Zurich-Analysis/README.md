# Zurich Airbnb Market Analysis – Investment Opportunity Assessment

## Target User: Real Estate Investor

This analysis is designed for real estate investors looking to enter Zurich’s short-term rental market. It provides actionable insights on neighborhood profitability, property types, and seasonal trends based on actual Airbnb data from Zurich.

## Data Analysis Approach

The dataset was processed through comprehensive cleaning and transformation steps, including:

- Duplicate removal and data type conversion  
- Creation of derived metrics  
- Price categorization (budget, economy, mid-range, premium)

The next phase involved data storytelling and visualization in Power BI to uncover clear market opportunities.

## Key Market Insights

### Neighborhood Profitability Analysis

Langstrasse and Altstetten emerged as the most promising neighborhoods, offering the best price-to-rating ratio. Average prices range between $190–$235, with guest ratings of 4.92 and 4.74 respectively. These areas present strong investment potential due to their balanced pricing and consistently high guest satisfaction.

### Seasonal Revenue Patterns

Profitability peaks between July and September, when availability is lowest and prices are at their highest. These seasonal trends should guide both acquisition timing and the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies to maximize return on investment.

### Property Type Segmentation

In the Premium segment, entire homes/apartments dominate (566 listings), while the Budget category is led by private rooms (387 listings). This segmentation suggests different strategies depending on available capital and target customer base.

## Investment Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I recommend the following strategies:

1. **Target Neighborhoods:** Focus on Langstrasse and Altstetten for an optimal balance of cost and return potential.  
2. **Property Types:** For higher-capital investments, premium entire homes offer the best revenue potential. For smaller budgets, budget private rooms provide a more accessible entry point.  
3. **Management Approach:** Ensure guest response times stay under one hour to command higher nightly prices.  
4. **Seasonal Strategy:** Apply dynamic pricing models that leverage the July–September peak season, with tailored strategies for each property type.
